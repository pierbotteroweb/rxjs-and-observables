## 🌊 Reactive Programming with RxJS (The Friendly Way)

This project uses **RxJS** — a powerful library that helps us work with data **over time** using something called **Observables**.

But don’t worry, here’s the no-jargon, plain-English version 👇

---

### 🧠 What are Observables?

Imagine you ordered pizza. You place the order, and then you wait. When the pizza is ready, it gets delivered to you. You don’t keep checking the oven yourself — you just wait for the delivery.

That’s exactly how **Observables** work! You **subscribe** to them and wait for something to happen:
- Data from an API
- User typing in a search box
- Button clicks
- Any other event over time

### 🔧 Useful RxJS Operators (with simple examples)

| Operator      | What It Does                     | Real-Life Example                                        |
|---------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `mergeMap`    | Runs multiple tasks at once      | Ordering multiple pizzas at the same time 🍕🍕🍕         |
| `switchMap`   | Cancels the last task on new one | You change your mind and reorder pizza before it arrives |
| `debounceTime`| Waits for a pause before acting  | Don’t send a search request until user stops typing ⌨️   |
| `takeUntil`   | Stops listening when told to     | Unsubscribing automatically when leaving the page        |

### 💡 Why It’s Useful

Reactive programming helps you:
- Make smooth live search features
- Avoid duplicate API calls
- Keep your app fast and responsive
- Clean up memory automatically
